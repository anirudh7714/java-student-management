Statement of the Project

This project is a console-based Student Management 
System developed using core Java.
The goal of this system is to provide a simple way 
to add, store, list, and generate reports for 
student data using a file-based storage approach.

Objectives

Implement a basic CRUD-like workflow for student 
data

Practice modular Java design using packages (main, 
model, services, utils)

Generate text-based reports in a structured format

Demonstrate file handling in Java without external 
libraries

Scope of the System

Add new student records

List all stored students

Generate formatted report files

Store data without using databases

Provide a menu-driven interface

Limitations

No update/delete functionality yet

Data stored in simple text files (not persistent 
DB)

Console-only UI

Conclusion

The project demonstrates understanding of 
object-oriented programming, modular code 
structure, and file handling in Java. It serves as 
a foundational system that can be expanded into a 
full-scale application.
